We will create a simple blog application in this tutorial.

SETUP
----------------------------------

1. Install symfony. Follow the instructions on
https://symfony.com/download.

  * Note that you need to make symfony accessible

2. Make sure symfony is accessible

  * On Unix:

      path with php ----v            v------ path with symfony
  $> export PATH="/opt/lampp/bin/:$HOME/.symfony/bin:$PATH"
  $> symfony --help

3. Check if the installation was successful

  $>  symfony check:requirements

4. Install composer, which is the PHP package manager (PHP refers to
packages as bundles). Follow the link below for instructions on how to
install composer.

  https://getcomposer.org/download/

5. Create an alias to facilitate invocation of composer

  $> alias composer='php ~/.symfony/composer/composer.phar'

6. Check if installation was successfull

  $> composer

  # without alias
  $> php ~/.symfony/composer/composer.phar

  Obs. You can create an alias to call this command just "composer"

7. Create a dummy project to demonstrate basic symfony commands.

  # --full instructs symfony/composer to install packages
  # most web apps will need
  $> symfony new dummy_project --full

  $> cd dummy_project

  # shows basic configuration info (e.g., version of PHP and Symfony)
  $> php bin/console about

  # start the server of your application
  $> symfony server:start

  # install a package for logging (just for fun)
  $> composer require logger

  # check for security vulnerabilities in bundles
  # List of security vulnerabilities --> https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories
  $> symfony check:security

  # delete the dummy project
  # cd ../ ; rm -rf dummy_project

CREATE APP FROM SKELETON
----------------------------------

1. Create the skeleton of our blog app

  $> composer create-project symfony/skeleton blog

2. cd into the directory

  $> cd blog

3. Install the following dependencies

  $> composer require symfony/orm-pack annotations validator template security-bundle
  $> composer require --dev maker-bundle

4. Check security

  $> symfony check:security
